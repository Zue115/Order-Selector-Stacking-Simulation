# Order Selector Stacking Simulation

## Overview

The **Order Selector Stacking Simulation** is a project designed to assist new order selectors in improving their stacking skills. The simulation creates a 3D environment where users can practice stacking various box weights and configurations, enhancing their efficiency and accuracy in warehouse operations. This tool aims to streamline training and optimize the order selection process.

## Features

- **3D Stacking Simulation**: Visualize and practice stacking boxes in a virtual environment.
- **Dynamic Weight Simulation**: Understand the effects of different box weights on stability and stacking techniques.
- **Customization**: Customize the stacking scenario to train specific stacks.
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor progress and performance metrics to identify areas for improvement.
- **Perfect Stacker**: Includes an algorithm that you can use to watch stack a pallet perfectly.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Graphics Library**: Pygame
- **Development Environment**: PyCharm
